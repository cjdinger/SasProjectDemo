# SAS custom task example: Test ISASProject APIs
***
This repository contains one of a series of examples that accompany
_Custom Tasks for SAS Enterprise Guide using Microsoft .NET_ 
by [Chris Hemedinger](http://support.sas.com/hemedinger).

This particular example relates to the topics in
**Chapter 4:  Meet the APIs**.  It was built using C# 
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  It should run in SAS Enterprise Guide 4.3 and later.

## About this example
This example is a simple test harness for the ISASProject APIs that
are supported by SAS Enterprise Guide.  It shows how you can navigate
the content of your active project and process flows, and gather
information about the tasks they contain.  You can detect and modify some of
the "link" relationships between the tasks in your project.

You can also query the project to get the generated SAS programs that each flow might
generate.
